# FlowForma AI Support Assistant

The FlowForma AI Support Assistant is a lightweight, fully offline question-answering application designed to assist users in retrieving information from a custom knowledge base. It is particularly useful for internal documentation support, product education, and self-service troubleshooting without requiring internet access or third-party APIs.

The system utilizes state-of-the-art open-source language models to understand user queries and generate relevant answers based on preloaded documents. It offers an intuitive browser-based interface through Streamlit and can be deployed locally or in a containerized environment.

## How It Works

1. **Knowledge Base Ingestion**: Text documents are loaded from a folder or zip archive. These are used as the source of truth for answering questions.
2. **Embedding Generation**: Each document is converted into a vector using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from SentenceTransformers.
3. **Vector Search**: When a question is asked, it is embedded and matched against the stored vectors using FAISS to retrieve the most relevant chunks of text.
4. **Answer Generation**: Retrieved chunks and the userâ€™s question are passed to the `google/flan-t5-base` model to generate a concise and relevant answer.
5. **User Interface**: A Streamlit front-end allows for user-friendly interaction and displays the question, sources, and AI-generated answer.
